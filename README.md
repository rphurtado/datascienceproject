### Introduction
We saw data about home prices based on certain factors, like delinquency rates, unemployment rates, GDP, building permits, and so on. As such, we are using a Python Notebook file to analyze the data and make predictions about these prices.

### Selection of Data
We obtained the dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jyotsnagurjar/factors-influencing-us-house-prices](Factors influencing US House Prices) from Kaggle. 

The dataset consists of 16 numeric features affecting house prices in the United States. (should we list them all? ) The data was already cleaned and tidy.  It consists of 240 complete data points.  There are no missing or null values.  

The only data that was not numeric was the Date feature, which was a Date/Time object.  We converted this to integer format to make it easier to use in visualizations and Machine Learning.   

### Methods
Tools:
*Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration and visualization
*Scikit-learn for prediction
*Replit
*Github for report collaboration and version control
*Google Collab for code collaboration
